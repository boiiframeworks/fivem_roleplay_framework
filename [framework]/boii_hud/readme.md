# BOII Development - HUD

## 🌍 Overview

A custom made hud to fit the BOII Development Roleplay Framework.
However it could easily be adapted to any framework you desire. 

The hud includes a status hud with space for buffs and debuffs, along with a human body model where injuries can be indicated.
Included is also a custom speedometer designed to try and give enough information without being too over facing.
The most contraversial part is the map positioning. We are aware this is not too everyones taste however this is an alpha project, nothing is set in stone, things can be changed.

Enjoy!

## 🌐 Features

- **Statuses HUD:** Player statuses hud covers health and armour, along with additional RP relevant statuses; hunger, thirst, hygiene, stress, oxygen.
- **Buffs & Debbufs Display:** Built into the status hud is display sections for both buffs and debuffs.
- **Player Injury Display:** Also built into the statuses hud is the player injury display. Injured body parts can be highlighted with one function.
- **Speedometer:** A custom speedometer is included. This allows players to see the vehicles speed, mileage, gear, fuel, body health and engine health.
- **Map:** The map has been modified to create a smaller square map on the top right of the screen. This is more reminiscent of RPG games or survival games. Some people like it some people dont, this may change. The map container covers distance to markers, cardianal directions, and street names.

## 💹 Dependencies

- **boii_utils**
- **boii_statuses** -- Optional you could modify the hud to not use statuses.

## 📝 Notes

- The hud is currently in alpha stages, do not expect a complete resource, some adjustments on your end may be required and some bugs are to be expected.
- Always ensure you are using the latest version of any dependancy to avoid compatibility issues.

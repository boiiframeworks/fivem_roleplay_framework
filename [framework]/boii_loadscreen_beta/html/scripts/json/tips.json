    "Tip 1: Always familiarize yourself with a server's specific rules and guidelines. Each FiveM server operates differently, and while some behaviors might be acceptable on one server, they might be frowned upon or even bannable on another. Taking a few minutes to read through the server rules can save you a lot of trouble down the line.",
    "Tip 2: Maintain a respectful communication etiquette. Keep your microphone muted when not speaking to prevent background noise disruptions. Remember, clear communication can be the difference between a successful mission and a failed one.",
    "Tip 3: Role-playing is at the heart of the FiveM experience. Dive into your character, develop a backstory, and interact with others in a way that's consistent with your role. It not only enhances your own experience but also that of other players around you.",
    "Tip 4: If you're new to FiveM or to a specific server, consider joining sessions or servers labeled as 'newbie-friendly'. These environments are often more forgiving and offer guidance on the basics, helping you get up to speed faster and with fewer hiccups.",
    "Tip 5: Respect is key in online communities. Even if you find yourself at odds with another player, faction, or gang, always maintain a level of respect. You never know when you might need allies, and building bridges is often more beneficial than burning them.",
    "Tip 6: Keep an eye out for special server events. These are often organized by server admins and can offer unique challenges, rewards, and role-playing opportunities that you won't find in everyday gameplay. Participating can be a great way to earn rare in-game items or currency.",
    "Tip 7: Consistency is crucial when role-playing. If you've established certain character traits or a backstory for your character, try to stick to it as much as possible. This consistency makes interactions more immersive and believable for everyone involved.",
    "Tip 8: Facing technical issues or glitches? Don't despair. The FiveM community is vast, with many forums and Discord channels dedicated to troubleshooting and helping players out. A quick search or a post detailing your issue can often yield solutions.",
    "Tip 9: Mods and custom content enhance the FiveM experience but ensure they're always updated. Compatibility is key, and running outdated mods can cause crashes or other unforeseen issues.",
    "Tip 10: At the end of the day, FiveM and all its servers are about entertainment and fun. It's easy to get caught up in in-game politics or disputes, but always remember the primary goal is enjoyment. Take breaks, explore different servers, and find the playstyle that brings you the most joy."

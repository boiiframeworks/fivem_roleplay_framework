## üåç Overview

Introducing the BOII Roleplay Framework!
This is a comprehensive roleplay server framework developed for FiveM, designed to enhance the immersive experience of FiveM roleplay communities. 
By providing a robust, modular, and highly customizable platform, BOII Framework can give you a solid start on the journey to creating your own FiveM server.

### Why Create Another LUA Framework?

Short answer: 

Why not, its fun? 

Long answer: 

The initial plan was to create our own in house framework and start a server using it, instead of having to heavily modify another commonly used framework to suite purpose. 
However due to the sheer amount of time involved with building it, and the time being taken away from the main resource releases and updates, the decision was made to release this as a free framework to give back a little to those who have been incredibly patient. 

As the project has developed the core has been broken up a little with additions of standalone resources running through boii_utils to remove some of the need for shared data sections and additional resources. The framework as a whole is currently in an alpha state, things will change, and things will be adjusted based on user feedback when time permits.

## üåê Features

- **Player Data Management:** The typical setup for creating a player object containing a variety of useful functions.
- **Player Statuses:** In-depth status system provided through our free release boii_statuses.
- **Item System:** In-depth item management system, with persistent droppable items provided by another free release boii_items.
- **Store System:** The core resource of the framework includes a simple store system currently running through a context menu, this will be updated and replaced with a boii_stores resource as soon as possible.
- **Banking System:** The core resource includes a simple banking system, also running through a context menu, this too will be replaced with boii_banking as soon as possible.
- **Inventory System:** The core resource also includes a very simple inventory setup running through context menu, again this will be replaced by boii_inventory as soon as possible.
- **Skills System:** The skills system for the framework is provided through our free developer library boii_utils.
- **Reputation System:** The reputation system for the framework is provided through our free developer library boii_utils.
- **Licence System:** The licence system for the framework is provided through our free developer library boii_utils.
- **Customisable UI Elements:** The framework is using our free release boii_ui as default. This means that all UI elements can be customised individually by players so they can make the server feel more custom to them. Our UI pack covers everything from context menus, to notifications, to progressbars.
- **Third Eye Targeting:** The framework currently runs all interactions entirely through our free target system boii_target. It might be adapted to use other things such as proximity draw text ui's however since this is an alpha build it is currently target or nothing.
- **Minigames:** The framework includes our free release boii_minigames. This will be used to run skill check games for a variety of additional future resources within the framework.
- **Heads Up Display:** Included is a custom hud built for the framework. Currently this is still a work in progress and will be subject to changes based on feedback. The hud is provided through our free release boii_hud.
- **Multicharacter Support:** The core resource contains a built in multicharacter system custom to the framework. This is still being worked on however it does provide full functionality.
- **Character Creation:** The core resource also includes a full character creation system built custom to the framework. System covers everything from clothing to tattoos.
- **Additional Features:** The rest of the commonly used framework features run through boii_utils. This is to enable any future BOII Development releases to be cross compatible out of the box with our framework and other commonly used frameworks. The utility library covers additional things like; callbacks, cooldowns, usable items, groups and much much more.
